## Locate-O-Pet

After long weeks in learning new skills, reading and working in our assignments, it all comes to this last project. This last project would be the opportunity to demnstrate our new skills, ready to either continue studying or seeking for a job. Once agian this is a group project, an opportunity to build a scalable MERN-stack single-page application that fulfills a real-world need, with a focus on data and user demand.

Have you ever lost something, anything? you wallet, you car keys? now you have it, now you don't! Imagine loosing your pet. Well, Locate-O-Pet is an application that will help you find your pet, by getting the community involved. You register, report where was the last time you have seen your pet, and other people would be able to notify seeing them.

Pet owners would be able to register, put a picture of their pet, add warnings -if necesary, and place a pin in the map. The map-pin would show the pet image and contact number. Additional personal information can be added to their profiles.

The application has been developed using MERN full stack web development. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. In MERN, Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js is the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Hope you enjoy our application!

Here is our product!
